# A Vagrant-powered project template

 - To make a new base box based on this template, copy the whole
   directory to `baseboxes/` with a different name, then edit the
   Makefile and change the box name.

 - To make a new Vagrant-powered development project, copy the whole
   directory someplace else, and delete the Makefile. Then edit the
   Vagrantfile to (e.g.) enable private networking and NFS syncing.
   Also, edit the Ansible configuration to perform your desired
   configuration.

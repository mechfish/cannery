# Cannery: A Set Of Packer Configurations

This is a collection of Packer and Vagrant config files.

At the moment, it's focused on building Virtualbox-provided Vagrant
boxes for Ubuntu, with various degrees of preconfiguring.

* In general, to make a box, change into the appropriate subdirectory
  and type `make`.

* Base boxes are built with Packer.

* More fully-configured boxes are layered atop the base box by:

  * Using Vagrant to boot a base box.
  * Configuring the base box using Ansible.
  * Exporting the base box for upload to S3.

# Cannery: A Set Of Packer Configurations

This is a collection of packer config files which build Vagrant boxes
for various versions of Linux.

At the moment it's focused primarily on Virtualbox.

Each build happens in stages:

* First a base VM is built, using `packer build basevm.json`, but not
  turned into a box. This contains the basic Linux install, but is
  missing the Virtualbox Guest Additions. Because Virtualbox has this
  tragic tendency to change every five freakin' minutes, the base box
  has to be rebuilt with new Guest Additions all the time. And because
  downloading Linux ISOs and packages from the internet is so effing
  slow, it's better to cache them in base-VM form.

* Then, a basebox is built from the base VM using `packer build
  basebox.json`.
